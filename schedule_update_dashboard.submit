# Program: schedule_update_dashboard.submit
# Programmer: Michael Fryar, Evidence for Policy Design
# Date created: August 8, 2017

# Purpose: This a submit description file which contains commands to direct the
# delayed execution of a script that downloads learner data from EPoDx digital
# units (as specified in write_to_g_sheet.py) and then uploads that data to a
# Google Sheet where it is cleaned and published to instructor dashboards.
# The script is executed under HTCondor which is the batch cluster resource
# manager for the Research Computing Environment (RCE) hosted by the
# Harvard-MIT Data Center (HMDC). In non-technical terms, HTCondor manages the
# HMDC's large, powerful pool of computers to determine how to allocate
# computing resources to the simultaneous demands of multiple users, which is
# why it is known as a distributed computing software. Condor has a CronTab
# scheduling functionality that allows jobs to be run at specified intervals or
# at a specific future date and time.

# Use the vanilla universe, which supports serial job processing.
