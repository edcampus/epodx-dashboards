# Project Title

This repository contains scripts that download learner data from [EPoDx](https://www.epodx.org) and upload it to
dashboards that help instructors customize instruction as part of a blended learning experience. The EPoDx units were
initially developed as part of the Building Capacity to Use Research Evidence (BCURE) program, funded by UK Aid from the
UK government.
