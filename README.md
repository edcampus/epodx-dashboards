# EPoDx Dashboards

This repository contains scripts that download learner data from
[EPoDx](https://www.epodx.org) and upload it to dashboards that help
instructors customize instruction as part of a blended learning experience. The
EPoDx units were initially developed as part of the Building Capacity to Use
Research Evidence (BCURE) program, funded by UK Aid from the UK government.
